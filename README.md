This is a fork of [AnimaTux](https://github.com/sethblocks/AnimaTux), renamed to AnimaMac. It targets macOS; behavior on other systems is unverified.

## Features
- Play animations or show images on your desktop or whatever app you are using
- Scale slider for image size
- Character library system for multiple characters
- If `ffmpeg` and `img2webp` are installed, selecting an APNG in the file picker will auto-convert to WebP
- If `steamcmd` and `ffmpeg` are installed, original AnimaEngine workshop items downloads are available
- Framerate slider for animations that need speed up or slowed down

## Dependencies
### Build
- Rust toolchain (stable) and `cargo`
